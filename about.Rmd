## About the blog
I'd love to say that this blog is going to be something that deals with cutting-edge research that happens in the field of Statistics/Mathematics, but then I'd be lying. The Symphony of Statistics is a blog run by myself, an amateur in the vast field that is Statistics. As of now, it wouldn't be featuring Statistics that is too difficult for a high schooler to grasp.

I will be posting regularly (every 3 days or so) about the interesting things that Statistics has to offer, and my experiences in taking the specialization by Duke University. The intended audience of this blog is statisticians, learners, and heck, anyone with the remotest interest in Statistics! This blog doesn't intend to be a comprehensive guide to statistics, but rather strives to be a source of informally presented explanations in various areas of Statistics.

Let me begin by introducing myself. I am [Siddharth Venu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidvenu), and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree from **National Institute of Technology, Trichy**, majoring in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I've always been a person with lots of interest in mathematics and statistics. I can't assert that I am really good at it (because I'm not), though I can assure you exploring the mathematical world brings me joy and this blog is to share it with everyone.

I have absolutely no prior experience in statistics other than from high school, a year of college and Udacity Courses on Descriptive and Inferential Statistics. I have talked with many Data Science experts, including experts from Google and interns from Microsoft, and have an exact idea how to carve out my career as a Data Scientist, and to help others become Data Scientists as well. I am taking the Coursera specialization **Statistics with R** by **Duke University** currently, in hopes of transforming that experience into establishing a Data Science career.

I have been an Android App Developer with over 5 years of experience, with contributions to the open source community in my priority list for the last few years. I was a participant in Google Code-in 2017, and an aspirant for GSoC 2020.

I have tried my hand at maintaining a blog previously, with one named [Mathematics Compilations](https://mathcompilations.blogspot.com/). I collaborated with few of my friends at school who had a lot of interest in math to maintain it. But, of course, we stopped posting and the blog fell into disuse (not that it was actually succesful, though). I am writing this on 18 of December, 2019 years after Jesus Christ was (supposedly) born, with a bit of skepticism - would this blog actually progress? I am positive about that :)

Hey everyone! I am a Computer Science Engineer from **RMK Engineering College** in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. I'm a student who found his true passion in programming. Curious as to why these programs worked the way they do, I started teaching myself how to code. I love the combination of creative and logical problem-solving skills which I get to use when writing code And I love the fact that there is always more to learn!

I was initially an enthusiastic Android App Developer, and soon after started learning MacOS Development as a part of my internship at Zoho Corp. I have also taken a couple of Machine Learning courses on Coursera and MOOC websites. 

Other than work I also cherish stuff like quizzing. Winning the *CL InQuizitive Minds Quiz Championship* (Tamil Nadu) Title gave me something I can be proud of and cherish for life. One of the things I learnt during that championship was to stay calm and composed and exude your knowledge for the outside world to know!

I don't really have much to say now, except for you to feel free to ask me anything with regards to MacOS Dev, MOOCs and ML!
